## Installation Instructions

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development

1. git clone https://github.com/JulianCurrie/RN-Components-JSX-Props-State.git
2. Make sure you are currently in your project directory. If npm is not already added to your global path variable, add it : 
* export PATH="path-to-npm/bin/:$PATH"
3. run 'npm install' to install necessary dependencies
4. In a separate terminal window, run 'react-native start' to initiate the metro bundler
5. While the bundler is running in the other window run either 'react-native run-ios' or 'react-native run-android' to start the app in their respective emulators. You may need to run 'adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081' when testing on a physical Android device to allow forwarding from your phone to your computer.
